Peripheral Template Library is currently licensed under the terms of LGPLv3,
though it's considered to either add linking exception clause or switch to
BSD-like license. To facilitate such change in the future, only BSD/MIT
licensed third-party code is merged, and contributors are asked to license
their patches under dual LGPL3/BSD license (or alternatively, just under BSD
license).

If you have suggestions regarding licensing, please feel free to bring them
up.
