Adding new target
=================

To add new target, following areas should be covered:

1. CPU initialization (in most cases this is simple or null).
2. GPIO
3. Timer

With this, it should be possible to use most of bitbanging
protocols, if CPU provides enough speed. For more fine-grained
bitbang protocol support, following is useful:

4. StaticDelay

Having hardware UART is quite helpful for debugging and host
communication overall.

5. Hardware UART

Further hardware features can be added on-demand depending on
particular application.
