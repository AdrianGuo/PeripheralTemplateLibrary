PTL tries to stick to C++03 whenever possible, and not use C++11 features.
That's because many embedded targets did not yet upgrade to recent versions
of gcc (4.7+).

So, following (very useful) C++11 features are avoided for now:

* Variadic templates
* constexpr
* Static assertions
* etc.

It's expected that these restrictions will be lifted once newer gcc versions
are better leveraged in embedded community.
