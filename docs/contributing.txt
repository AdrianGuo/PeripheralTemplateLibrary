Peripheral Template Library is currently licensed under the terms of LGPLv3,
though it's considered to either add linking exception clause or switch to
BSD-like license. To facilitate such change in the future, only BSD/MIT
licensed third-party code is merged, and contributors are asked to license
their patches under dual LGPL3/BSD license (or alternatively, just under BSD
license).

The rationale of this request is that, if such licensing change is carried
out in the future, all contributors will need to be contacted to ask their
permissions to relicense, with possible complications that some contributors
won't respond, or will be against such change. So, instead I'm asking all
potential contributors about BSD licensing right away. I hope this makes
sense and reasonably fair.

If you have suggestions regarding licensing, please feel free to bring them
up.
